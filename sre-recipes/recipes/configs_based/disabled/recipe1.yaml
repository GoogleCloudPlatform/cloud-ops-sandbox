  This implements recipe 1, which purposefully breaks encoding logic in the 
  email service, which is a part of the checkout flow for sending order 
  confirmation emails.
config:
  break:
    - action: run-shell-commands
      commands:
        - kubectl set env deployment/emailservice ENCODE_EMAIL=true
        - kubectl delete pod $(kubectl get pod -l app=emailservice -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
        - kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deployment/emailservice
  restore:
    - action: run-shell-commands
      commands:
        - kubectl set env deployment/emailservice ENCODE_EMAIL=false
        - kubectl delete pod $(kubectl get pod -l app=emailservice -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
        - kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deployment/emailservice
  hint: |
    Visit the external IP of the demo application and try buying some products. 
    You can also use monitoring dashboards to see metrics associated with each 
    service, and use Cloud Logging to view logs exported by each service. 
    Note: It may take up to 5 minutes for monitoring metrics to be updated.
    You can also use `sandboxctl describe` to get information (such as project 
    ID, logs, core URLs) for your sandbox.
