name: Currency Recipe
description: |
  This implements recipe 0, which purposefully introduces latency into the 
  frontend service by doing a lot of unnecessary currency conversions.

  hint: |
    Visit the external IP of the demo application to see if there are any 
    visible changes. You can also use monitoring dashboards to see metrics 
    associated with each service. Note: It may take up to 5 minutes for 
    monitoring metrics to be updated. You can also use `sandboxctl describe`
    to get information (such as project ID, logs, core URLs) for your sandbox.
