# Here we are creating a project to contain the deployed resources. A couple of
# general terraform notes: this is the first time we're seeing the `data`
# stanza. This gives a way to look stuff up and use it in other resources. Here
# we're looking up the billing account by name (hence why the README has you
# name it a certain way) so we can pass its ID on later.
#
# If productized we'd drop this and use the default billing account instead.

# Enable GKE in the project we created. If you look at the docs you might see
# the `google_project_services` resource which allows you to specify a list of
# resources to enable. This seems like a good idea but there's a gotcha: to use
# that resource you have to specify a comprehensive list of services to be
# enabled for your project. Otherwise it will disable services you might be
# using elsewhere.
#
# For that reason, we use the single service option instead since it allows us
# granular control.

  # You'll see this line in every resource we create from here on out. This is
  # necessary because we didn't configure the provider with a project because
  # the project didn't exist yet. This could be refactored such that the project
  # was created outside of terraform, the provider configured with the project,
  # and then we don't have to specify this on every resource any more.
  #
  # Anyway, expect to see a lot more of these. I won't explain every time.
