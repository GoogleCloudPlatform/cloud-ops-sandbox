The last released version of the project was [0.9.4](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-ops-sandbox/releases/tag/0.9.4).
The version did not feature SRE recipies.
Sandbox deployed the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) microservice demo application v0.8.1.

You still should be able to deploy Sandbox by launching an interactive tutorial in the Cloud console.
To do that, press "launch" button below.

[![Launch in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell_git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgooglecloudplatform%2Fcloud-ops-sandbox&cloudshell_git_branch=0.9.4&cloudshell_tutorial=docs/walkthrough.md)

Remember that launching Sandbox provisions a GKE cluster that incurs billing costs.
