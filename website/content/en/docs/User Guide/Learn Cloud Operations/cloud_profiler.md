#### Profiler Overview

Cloud Profiler ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/profiler/docs/)) performs statistical sampling on your running application. Depending on the language, it can capture statistical data on CPU utilization, heap size, threads, and so on. You can use the charts created by the Profiler UI to help identify performance bottlenecks in your application code. 

You do not have to write any profiling code in your application; you simply need to make the Profiler library available (the mechanism varies by language). This library will sample performance traits and create reports, which you can then analyze with the Profiler UI.

The following Online Boutique microservices are configured to capture profiling data:

-  Checkout service
-  Currency service
-  Frontend
-  Payment service
-  Product-catalog service
-  Shipping service

#### Using Profiler

Select **Profiler** from the GCP navigation menu to open the Profiler home page. It comes up with a default configuration and shows you the profiling graph:

You can change the service, the profile type, and many other aspects of the configuration For example, to select the service you'd like to view Profiler data for, choose a different entry on the **Service** pulldown menu:

Depending on the service you select and the language it's written in, you can select from multiple metrics collected by Profiler:

> See ["Types of profiling available"](https://cloud.google.com/profiler/docs/concepts-profiling#types_of_profiling_available) for information on the specific metrics available for each language.

Profiler uses a visualization called a flame graph to represents both code execution and resource utilization. See ["Flame graphs"](https://cloud.google.com/profiler/docs/concepts-flame) for information on how to interpret this visualization. You can read more about how to use the flame graph to understand your service's efficiency and performance in  ["Using the Profiler interface"](https://cloud.google.com/profiler/docs/using-profiler#profiler-graph).
