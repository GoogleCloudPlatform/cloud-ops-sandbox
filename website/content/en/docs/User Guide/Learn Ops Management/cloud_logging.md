#### Logging Overview

Operators can look at [logs](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs) in [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/) to find clues explaining any anomalies in the metrics charts. 

#### Using Logging

You can access Cloud Logging by selecting **Logging** from the GCP navigation menu. This brings up the Logs Viewer interface:

The Logs Viewer allows you to view logs emitted by resources in the project using search filters provided.  The Logs Viewer lets you select standard filters from pulldown menus. 

##### An example: server logs

To view all container logs emitted by pods running in the default namespace, use the Resources and Logs filter fields (these default to **Audited Resources** and **All logs**):

1. For the resource type, select **GKE Container -> cloud-ops-sandbox -> default**
2. For the log type,  select **server**

The Logs Viewer now displays  the logs generated by pods running in the default namespace:

##### Another example: audit logs

To see logs for  all audited actions that took place in the project during the specified time interval:

1. For the resource type, select **Audited Resources > All services**
1. For the log type, select** All logs**
1. For the time interval, you might have to experiment, depending on how long your project has been up.

The Logs Viewer now shows all audited actions that took place in the project during the specified time interval:

##### Exporting logs

Audit logs contain the records of who did what. For long-term retention of these records, the recommended practice is to create exports for audit logs. You can do that by clicking on **Create Sink**:

Give your sink a name, and select the service  and destination to which you will export your logs. We recommend using a less expensive class of storage for exported audit logs, since they are not likely to be accessed frequently. For this example, create an export for audit logs to Google Cloud Storage.

Click **Create Sink**. Then follow the prompts to create a new storage bucket and export logs there:
