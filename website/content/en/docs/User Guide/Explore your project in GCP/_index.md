## Explore your project in GCP

In another browser tab, navigate to the GCP GKE Dashboard URL, which takes you to the Kubernetes Engine ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/)) **Workloads** page for the project created by the installer:

## Explore Cloud Monitoring

In a new browser tab, navigate to the GCP Monitoring Workspace URL, which takes you to the Cloud Monitoring ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring)) **Workspace** page for your new project. The console may take some time to create a new workspace. Afterward, you'll be able to see a few dashboards generated through Ops Management tools.

## Shop like a hipster!

In a new browser tab, navigate to the Hipster Shop URL, where you can "purchase" everything you need for your hipster lifestyle using a mock credit card number:

## Run the load generator

In another browser tab, navigate to the load-generator URL, from which you can simulate users interacting with the application to generate traffic. For this application, values like 100 total users with a spawn rate of 2 users per second are reasonable. Fill in the **Host** field with the "Hipster shop web address" from the installation stage if it isn't prepopulated. Click the **Start swarming** button to begin generating traffic to the site.

From here, you can explore how the application was deployed, and you can use the navigation menu to bring up other GCP tools.
