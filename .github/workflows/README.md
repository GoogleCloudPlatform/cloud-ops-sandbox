# GitHub Actions Workflows

workloads run using [GitHub self-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-self-hosted-runners)

## Setup

1. Create a GCE instance for running tests
    - VM should be at least n1-standard-4 with 100GB persistent disk
    - VM should be created with no service account
2. SSH into new VM through Google Cloud Console
3. Follow the instructions to add a new runner on the [Actions Settings page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/stackdriver-sandbox/settings/actions) to authenticate the new runner
4. Attach the `kind-cluster` tag to the new runner
5. Set GitHub Actions as a background service
    - `sudo ~/actions-runner/svc.sh install ; sudo ~/actions-runner/svc.sh start`
6. Run the following command to install dependencies
    - `wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/stackdriver-sandbox/master/.github/workflows/install-dependencies.sh | bash`

## Setup - Push Enabled

Some actions require authentication to GCP to push container images. These workers need extra setup

**Note:** only one worker in the pool requires this additional setup. Try to avoid granting privileges to workers that don't need them

1. Provision the VM with a service account with write access to your GCR data bucket
2. Ensure `PROJECT_ID` is set properly in the [repo's secrets](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/stackdriver-sandbox/settings/secrets)
3. Tag the new worker with `push-privilege` on the [Actions Settings page](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/stackdriver-sandbox/settings/actions)

## Workflows

### ci.yaml

#### Triggers

- commits pushed to master
- PRs to master
- PRs to release/ branches

#### Actions

- ensures kind cluster is running
- builds all containers in src/
- deploys local containers to kind
  - ensures all pods reach ready state
  - ensures HTTP request to frontend returns HTTP status 200

### push-master.yaml

#### Triggers
- commits pushed to master

#### Actions
- builds and pushes images to official GCR repo tagged with git commit
- builds and pushes images to official GCR repo tagged as latest

### push-tags.yaml

#### Triggers
- tags pushed to repo

#### Actions
- builds and pushes images to official GCR repo tagged with git tag name
